# cmake

## What is cmake ?

cmake is a cross-platform free and open-source software for build automation, testing, packaging and installation of software by using a compiler-independent method. CMake is not a build system itself; it generates another system's build files.

## Why it is so popular ?

Couldn't find a better answer fits more than this comment [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/12kowb4/comment/jg3ouxk/). In short, it provides an abstraction layer for the target platform, tools, ... etc.
